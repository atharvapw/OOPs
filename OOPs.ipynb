        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "* OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (functions). It promotes code reusability, modularity, and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "* A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "* An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with state (attributes) and behavior (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Abstraction: Hides implementation details and shows only necessary features (focus on what).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Encapsulation: Binds data and methods into a single unit and restricts direct access (focus on how).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "* Dunder (double underscore) methods like __init__, __str__, __len__ provide special functionality (also called magic methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "* Inheritance allows a class (child) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent), promoting reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "* Polymorphism means \"many forms\". It allows the same method name to have different behaviors depending on the object (e.g., method overriding).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "* By making attributes private (prefix _ or __) and providing getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "* __init__() is the constructor method, automatically called when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class method (@classmethod): Works with the class itself, takes cls as parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Static method (@staticmethod): Independent of class/instance, like a normal function inside class.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "* Python doesn’t support true overloading, but it can be mimicked using default arguments or *args.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "* When a child class provides its own implementation of a parent class method with the same signature.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "* @property is used to define getter methods that can be accessed like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "* It improves flexibility and reusability, allowing one interface to work with different object types.\n",

        "It improves flexibility and reusability, allowing one interface to work with different object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "* A class with at least one abstract method (@abstractmethod) defined in abc module. Cannot be instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Advantages of OOP?\n",
        "* Code reusability\n",
        "* Modularity\n",
        "* Easy maintenance\n",
        "* Extensibility\n",
        "* Data security\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Difference between class variable and instance variable?\n",
        "* Class variable: Shared across all objects (defined at class level).\n",
        "* Instance variable: Unique to each object (defined in __init__).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "* When a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods?\n",
        "* __str__: User-friendly string representation (for print()).\n",
        "* __repr__: Developer-friendly representation (for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Significance of super() function in Python?\n",
        "* Used to call methods from the parent class inside a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. Significance of __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "* It is the destructor method, called when an object is deleted or garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?\n",
        "\n",
        "* @staticmethod: Doesn’t take self or cls, behaves like normal function.\n",
        "\n",
        "* @classmethod: Takes cls, modifies class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "* Through method overriding — different subclasses can redefine the same method differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "* Returning self from a method allows multiple methods to be called in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Purpose of __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "* Makes an object callable like a function.\n",
